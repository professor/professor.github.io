We Know the Way - Phonetic Lyrics - Moana

Thank you Opetaia Foa'i for this fantastic song. It is my favorite
from the Moana sound track.

I wanted to learn this song, yet the official lyrics are in Samoan, Tokelauan, and English (I think). Since I only speak English, I created these phonetic lyrics.

I slowed the music to 70% normal speed and listened over and over again. Note, we might not have all the phonemes in English.

Ta-toe Ta-na-to-pho-low

Flah-ee-ow-ee-nah

Le'-tua-tsome knee-te-lay

A-ohm-my

Oo-ah-pah el-lay-lu-ah toa-le-eh

Ta-fi-na-fi-nigh

Oh-loh oh-loh tah-kah

Away Away

Ku-ku-en-new-ah

Te mah new lay lay A ta key A

Away Away

Tef-en-new-tim-mall-ee-A

Nah echo hockey lee-ah

Kah-ang nah-A

One of my hobbies is improv, and I play a game where we get our partner
to guess multi-syllabic words by acting out each phoneme.
