Creating a readability metric presents several challenges.

Consider this list of famous authors, which author is the most skilled writer? 

Stephenie Meyer 
Orson Scott Card
William Shakespeare
Agatha Christie 
Charles Dickens 


Consider these two fragments of text, which is easier to read?

{% blockquote A random quote from, Anthony and Cleopatra %}
He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote A random quote from, Gate Thief %}
Danny hadn’t had enough sleep, but his inner clock woke him at exactly the time required for him to make it to Coach Lieder’s house for a special practice. Now that Danny had capitulated and ran…
{% endblockquote %}

Most people would say that the text written by a less skilled writer is easier to read than the text of the master writer, Shakespeare. Now you might say that using text from 1623 near the end of the great vowel shift is unfair. Here are two samples from recently written books.
