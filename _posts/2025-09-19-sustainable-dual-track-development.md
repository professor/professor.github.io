# Sustainable Dual-Track Development

I'm delighted to announce that my agile software development book is in print. While at Pivotal, I earned my Ph.D. by
studying what made Pivotal's teams so successful. It had been 20+ years since the Extreme Programming books had been
written and I wanted to share how Pivotal had evolved the XP practices. We knew the practices were successful
and my research helped understand the fundamental underpinnings on why it was successful.

Little did I know that it would take me eight years to finish writing this book. With my co-author Paul Ralph, we combined these industry practices with academic research.
