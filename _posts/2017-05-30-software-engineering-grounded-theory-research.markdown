If you are using Grounded Theory to conduct research in software engineering, I would love to hear from you. Please contact me at [professor at gmail.com]
 
If you are starting out on grounded theory research, I would suggest this plan of action:

1. Determine with variant of Grounded Theory that you want to use. Options include:
   * Classic / Glasserian grounded theory
   * Straussian grounded theory
   * Constuctivist grounded theory
1. Read [Stol's comparison](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287491381_Grounded_Theory_in_Software_Engineering_Research_A_Critical_Review_and_Guidelines) of the three major variants and recommendations on how to write grounded theory research.     
1. Read my [lessons learned paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314081058_Lessons_Learned_from_an_Extended_Participant_Observation_Grounded_Theory_Study)
1. Read a few exemplars (e.g. [Software Development Waste](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313360479_Software_Development_Waste), [Becoming Agile](https://rashinadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/hoda-becomingagile-icse2017-preprint.pdf))
1. If you select Constructivist grounded theory, then read [Charmazâ€™s Constructing Grounded Theory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0857029142/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0857029142&linkCode=as2&tag=sedano-20&linkId=11734cd973c525d633fcfeeac3245f7b)
1. If you select Glasserian grounded theory, then read [Hoda's Grounded Theory for Geeks](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/460c/9e0abe4ad1127da6410c912656ddda67510c.pdf) and read Glaser's books in order.
   
This month I finished my Ph.D. I have used grounded theory for the last three years. I have found the method extremely rewarding. I loved interviewing, participant observation, and analyzing the data. There will be moments of confusion with the data. Embrace the confusion, on the other side tends to rewarding research results.
