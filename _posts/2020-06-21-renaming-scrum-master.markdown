Renaming the Scrum Master role. On my team, we're discussing "scrum facilitator" or "scrum enabler." I asked twitter for ideas and here's what you all came up with.

Suggestions

* Scrum facilitator
* Scrum coach (Jay Bazuzi: I want to discourage thinking of the role as "keeper of the backlog, scheduler of the meetings.")
* Scrum leader
* Scrum guide
* Scrum moderator
* Scrum wrangler
* Scrum navigator
* Scrum curator
* Scrum ordinator
* Scrum conductor
* Agile coach
* Flow coach
* Team facilitator
* Team coach
* Team enabler
* Team champion
* Process Guardian
* Value stream manager
* Driver
* Servant leader
* Scrum enabler
* Agility advocate

Personally, I'm liking Scrum Facilitator â„¢

And if you need a laugh, here are the more fun suggestions:

* Ceremonial leader
* Scrumpire
* Scrummers
* Scrummees
* Scrum diddly umptuous
* Scrum-i-kanban-agilistic-xp-lean-idocious, even though the sound of it is something quite precocious.
* Scrumbag
* Chief Cat Herder
* Head Plate Spinner
* Ringleader of the Process
* Captain Delicious
* S-crummy-licious
