## Summer Workshops
I'm offering a series of my best workshops in order to raise money for the global 99%. Normally, I charge exorbitant fees for these sessions. I'm donating my time, and I'm asking attendees to make a $25 donation. All proceeds will be used to provide clean water for a refugee community fleeing genocide.

### Agile Estimation 
At the back of every engineer is the dreaded question "Are we on track for finishing by the deadline?" You'll learn easy to implement techniques for tracking progress.

Saturday 6/16/2012 10:00 am - 12:00 noon

### Code readability
Most engineers dislike reading other people's code. This workshop introduces a technique to help make your code more readable. Research shows that code that is easy to read is much more maintainable. Improve your craft as a software developer. 

Saturday 7/7/2012 10:00 am - 12:00 noon

### Improv for engineers
You will learn the fundamental techniques for improvisational acting including active listening, acceptance of other's ideas, serving the narrative, and commitment. Using these techniques, engineers can learn new ways to generate novel solutions to complex problems, build high-trust teams, brainstorm without critiquing, and overcome anxiety when public speaking. The emphasis of the workshop is on creativity and spontaneity, not performance.

Saturday 7/21/2012 10:00 am - 12:00 noon

### Improv: living for what matters
How do we learn what really matters in life? Often there's a disconnect between what we know and what we do with respect to careers, family, and money. Participants will be challenged to reassess their life priorities.

Saturday 8/4/2012 10:00 am - 12:00 noon

### Improv: movement and leadership
Our bodies. We live in them. We go everywhere in them. Yet, what can they tell us about leadership? We'll explore the themes of movement and see how it impacts our relationships using improv exercises

Saturday 8/18/2012 10:00 am - 12:00 noon


### Be the Change: Patterns of Organizational Change
How do you effect change in your organization? Researchers studied successful strategies for adopting change and created several patterns. I find these patterns useful for inspiration whenever I get stuck with my own initiatives. In this workshop, we'll explore many of these patterns and allow time for participants in small groups to brainstorm a plan for their own idea and company.

Tuesday 8/14/2012 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm. This is a free meetup event, [register here](http://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Agile-Leadership-Network/events/55525752/)

### Fresh water for the world
<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/clean_water.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1335620544544" alt=""/></span></span>

The Aymara people of Bolivia live in one of the driest places on earthâ€”a towering windswept plateau where months pass with virtually no rain. Your contribution will help Aymara families by digging wells and supplying hand-pumps (pictured). Costs range from $400 for a hand-dug well serving a few families to $10,000 for a deep drilled well serving an entire community.
