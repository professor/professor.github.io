### Improv for Engineers ™
Your team will learn the fundamental techniques for improvisational acting including active listening, acceptance of other's ideas, serving the narrative, and commitment. Using these techniques, engineers can learn new ways to generate novel solutions to complex problems, build high-trust teams, brainstorm without critiquing, and overcome anxiety when public speaking. The emphasis of the workshop is on creativity and spontaneity, not performance.
